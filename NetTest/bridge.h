 * address of port having port ID 0 of the bridge. Element 1 is the

 * Bridge *bridge: The bridge to be executed.

 * BPDUs and dataframes received by the bridge since it last
 * executed. The MACQueueElements need to be processed during the
 * Execute funtion, along with any other activity to be performed
 * (i.e. sending of BPDUs, forwarding data frames). The frames in the
 * MACQueueElement linked list are in chronological order according to
 * when they were received.

 * unsigned long step: this is NOT USED for this assignment. In
 * practice, bridges keep timers for different purposes and this field
 * provides a time step increment each time the Excecute function is
 * run. It indicates the amount of time elapsed since last
 * execution. Since this assignment does not include dynamic changes
 * in the topology that require timers to be kept, you should IGNORE
 * this field.
 *
 * Return from this subroutine when you are done processing all the
 * frames in the queue and performing any other activity that was
 * required. Return 0 upon successful execution 1 otherwise. If the
 * bridge needs to send frames as part of its execution, use the
 * following function call implemented in the simulator: void
 * SendMACFrame(int MACaddress, MACFrame frame); The function
 * SendMACFrame takes on the MAC address of the sending port, and the
 * frame to be sent. The MAC address is a simulation-wide unique
 * identifier for each port which is specified by the simulation
 * configuration file
 * 
 * You do not have to worry about freeing the memory for the receive
 * queue. The simulator performs this task.
